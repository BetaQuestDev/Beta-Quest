  "body": "### **Welcome to The Beta Quest Download Site.**\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is Beta Quest?\r\n**Beta Quest** is a multi-genre indie game created by professional shitposter NopeCartoons. The game has you play as a lonely hooded adventurer determined to make his mark on a world that's ever so crumbling around him. \r\n\r\n(*This game is filled with shit references to much better games, like the reference to* **Ticket** *seen above.*)\r\n\r\n### If it's so bad, why should I play this game?\r\nI don't really know why. Maybe if you like playing bad games, or just seeing what it has to offer. I wanted to put the game online just to see what happens, what people think of this pile of **TRASH**. It also proves Canadian and American humor is very different.  \r\n\r\n### Download Links\r\n\r\nNo versions available.\r\n\r\n### Credits \r\nPretty much just me at the moment.",
