<p><strong>Beta Quest</strong> is a multi-genre indie game created by professional shitposter NopeCartoons. The game has you play as a lonely hooded adventurer determined to make his mark on a world that's ever so crumbling around him. It's not a very good game.</p>

<p>(<em>This game is filled with shit references to much better games, like the reference to</em> <strong>Ticket</strong> <em>seen above.</em>)</p>

<p>I don't really know why. Maybe if you like playing bad games, or just seeing what it has to offer. I wanted to put the game online just to see what happens, what people think of this pile of <strong>TRASH</strong>. It also proves Canadian and American humor is very different.  </p>
